## 📋 Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis case study focusing on smart device usage trends for **Bellabeat**, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. By analyzing FitBit user data, I aimed to uncover insights that could drive Bellabeat’s future marketing strategies.

## 💡 The Key Insight: The Activity-Sleep Paradox
The most significant finding of this analysis is a **moderate negative correlation (-0.42)** between daily physical activity and sleep duration. 
* **Observation:** As users increase their steps and calories burned, their average sleep time decreases.
* **Impact:** Highly active users may be sacrificing essential recovery time, which offers a unique opportunity for Bellabeat to position itself as a "Balanced Wellness" guide.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **R Programming** (tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, janitor)
* **Kaggle Notebooks**
* **Google Data Analytics Framework** (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act)

## 📂 Project Structure
* **Ask:** Identifying the business task and key stakeholders.
* **Prepare:** Assessing data integrity (ROCCC) and sources.
* **Process:** Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
* **Analyze:** Uncovering trends and correlations using R.
* **Share:** Visualizing findings with professional charts.
* **Act:** Providing data-driven recommendations for stakeholders.

## 🏁 Recommendations for Bellabeat
1. **"Recovery Score" Feature:** Introduce a tool that suggests rest periods based on activity intensity.
2. **Balanced Marketing:** Shift marketing messaging from "Work Harder" to "Rest to Power."
3. **Smart Notifications:** Automate sleep reminders on high-activity days.
